================================================================================
SESSION: 2026-02-13 — Baseline + Workflow Setup
================================================================================

## Context
- All previous development was uncommitted (60+ files modified/added since initial release)
- No git history existed for any feature work
- CLAUDE.md was outdated (didn't document Explore feature, new services, etc.)
- No progress tracking existed between sessions

## Completed This Session

[DONE] Baseline commit (ac3017f) — all development work since initial release
  - 74 files changed: +7,907 / -6,463 lines
  - This captures everything built in previous sessions that was never committed

[DONE] CLAUDE.md v2 — restructured to Meta-grade engineering standards
  - Numbered sections (1-11) instead of emoji-only headers
  - Product philosophy updated: now documents TWO journeys (Pick For Me + Explore)
  - Full file tree reflects actual codebase (48 Swift files documented)
  - Removed references to deleted files (MovieFilter, GWRecommendationSession, etc.)
  - Added new files (ExploreService, WatchlistManager, AuthGuard, etc.)
  - Screen flow diagram shows both journeys
  - Ralph Wiggum workflow section added (Section 1.4)
  - Known issues table with severity ratings
  - Gotchas consolidated and tightened

[DONE] progress.txt created — this file, session-to-session memory

## What Was Built (reconstructed from baseline commit)

### Core App Improvements
- GWRecommendationEngine: enhanced scoring + content type filtering
- Movie.swift: expanded model (OTTProvider, EmotionalProfile, SupabaseService)
- RootFlowView: dual-journey support (Pick For Me + Explore, 12 screen enum cases)
- InteractionService: expanded interaction tracking + maturity system
- All onboarding screens: visual polish, poster backgrounds, animations

### Explore Feature (complete)
- ExploreView: 6-tab bottom bar container
- ExploreAuthView: dedicated sign-up-mandatory auth for Explore
- ExploreService: Supabase-backed search/filter/sort (complex REST queries)
- WatchlistManager: UserDefaults per-user watchlist persistence
- 14 explore sub-screens: Discover, New Releases, Platform, Rent, Watchlist, Profile
  (each with ViewModel + Tab view pattern)

### New Infrastructure
- UserContext.swift: OTTPlatform, Mood, Language (16 languages) enums
- UserModels.swift: GWUser, GWUserProfile, GWInteraction, GWFeedback
- AuthGuard.swift: authentication enforcement with anonymous fallback
- OTTLanguageAvailability.swift: platform × language content matrix
- DesignSystem.swift: centralized design tokens (Theme/ directory)
- PrimaryButton.swift + AppLogo.swift: reusable UI components

### Removed Legacy
- Deleted: HomeView, DiscoverView, WatchlistView, ProfileView, etc. (old tab bar era)
- Deleted: GWRecommendationSession, UITrustChecklist, GWLocalProfileStore, GoodWatchScorer
- Deleted: MovieFilter (consolidated into ExploreService)
- Deleted: Theme.swift (replaced by DesignSystem.swift)

### Database Migrations
- 20260210000001_update_derive_tags_v2.sql — tag derivation v2
- 20260210122158_drop_users_fk.sql — users FK fix
- 20260211000001_security_hardening.sql — RLS + security policies

## Blockers
- None currently

## Pending / Not Started
- [PENDING] Commit and push web + marketing repo uncommitted changes
- [PENDING] Verify Explore feature builds and runs on simulator
- [PENDING] Verify app compiles after baseline commit (no build test done this session)
- [PENDING] Push iOS baseline commit to origin/main

## Notes for Next Session
- The baseline commit preserves ALL work but hasn't been build-tested
- 7 TypeScript files in screens/ are old artifacts — kept intentionally
- Build logs, temp files, and screenshots are still untracked (intentionally not committed)
- From now on: every feature follows Ralph workflow (PRD → stories → commit per story → update this file)
